## ✨ Introduction
The **IoT-Based Smart Pet Feeder** is a modern solution for pet care, offering automation and convenience. It ensures timely feeding, real-time food level monitoring, and portion customization through a mobile app, making pet care simpler and more efficient.

---

## 🚨 Problem and Solution

### ❌ Problem
- Inconsistent feeding schedules due to work or travel.
- Health risks from irregular feeding.
- No real-time monitoring or notifications for food levels.

### ✅ Solution
The **IoT-Based Smart Pet Feeder** addresses these challenges by leveraging IoT technology to:
- Automate feeding schedules.
- Provide real-time food level monitoring.
- Notify owners via a mobile app.

### 🛠️ Key Features
- **Remote Feeding Control**: Feed pets anytime, anywhere.
- **Low Food Alerts**: Get notified when food is running low.
- **Customizable Portions**: Adjust feeding portions for pet health.
- **Flexible Feeding Modes**: Choose between manual or scheduled feeding.
